# RustLlama
An application made for Ollama, in Rust!
---
Yes, this is an application for Ollama made with Rust. This is a side project, and not a full-time project that I am working on. This won't be maintained much, but if any bugs occur, make a pull request ðŸ˜‰

***This application requires [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/). Also, this has only been tested on Linux Fedora Workstation, so you may need extra peripherals.***

### Roadmap:
---
- Frontend: 75%
- Backend: 100%
- Status: 90%

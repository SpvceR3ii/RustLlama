# RustLlama
## An application made for Ollama, in Rust!
Yes, this is an application for Ollama made with Rust. This is a side project, and not a full-time project that I am working on. This won't be maintained much, but if any bugs occur, make a pull request/issue ticket.

***This application requires [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/). Also, this has only been tested on a Linux Fedora Workstation instance, so you may need extra peripherals such as gcc headers and the Rust language.***

### Setup:
Visit the [Setup Docs](https://github.com/SpvceR3ii/RustLlama/blob/master/docs/setup.md) to continue from here. All of the information required is displayed there. If you need further help, join our Eclipse Studios Discord Server.

### Roadmap:
---
- Frontend: 0% | *A rework of the entire application will be posted soon. It will use the egui rust library, a UI library made to create applications and clients seamlessly.*
- Backend: 100%
- Status: 90%

### This is not the final publish! A lot more is expected to come out, and I am still working hard to get a lot published. If you'd like to stay updated, join our Discord!
